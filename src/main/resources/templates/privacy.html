                    ruling of 12 May 1998, the district court (Landgericht) of Hamburg decided that with the displaying
                    of a link, a website operator can under certain circumstances be held liable for the contents of the
                    linked web page. According to the district court, this can only be avoided by explicitly distancing
                    oneself from these contents. Thus, the for this website responsible persons declare: "We hereby
                    disclaim responsibility for the content of all websites mentioned or linked here. We are not
